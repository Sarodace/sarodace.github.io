[{"content":"My name is Jonathan, an Electrical Engineer with a passion for art, design, and philanthropy. Since graduating from WPI, I have been working at Analog Devices as an Applications Engineer on products that help enable the shift to 5G and have gained experience with project management, cross-team collaboration, and ensuring that our customer\u0026rsquo;s questions and concerns about products are answered and addressed.\nAfter work, I take classes for my MS ECE at WPI (so my freetime is non-existent ðŸ˜”). Once I graduate in May 2023, I\u0026rsquo;ll be working on projects and hobbies that I\u0026rsquo;ve had to leave in the planning stage due to my severe lack of time. Until then, feel free to look around and remember to check back :) !\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re here to gauge my technical knowledge, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend you start by looking at my projects in Hardware and Software.\nPhoto by Pawel Czerwinski on Unsplash\n","date":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://sarodace.github.io/p/hello-world/cover_hud7e36f7e20e71be184458283bdae4646_55974_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://sarodace.github.io/p/hello-world/","title":"Welcome to my website!"},{"content":"Welcome to Hugo theme Stack.
